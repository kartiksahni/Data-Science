# A/B Testing with Online News Popularity Dataset

This repo is all about A/B testing with the Online News Popularity dataset. We'll compare the average shares of articles published on weekdays versus weekends.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "Online News Popularity" dataset, which has features related to news articles and their popularity. You can grab it from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).

## Usage

1. Download the "Online News Popularity" dataset and place it in the same directory as the code files.

2. Run the code in an IPython Notebook or any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.

3. The code is divided into cells for better organization. Execute each cell to perform the A/B test.

4. The results will be printed, showing the average shares for weekdays and weekends, t-statistic, p-value, and conclusion.

## Notes

- The code assumes the dataset file is named "Onlinenewspopularity.csv". If your file has a different name, update it in the code.

- Feel free to modify the code for different A/B tests. Adjust the columns for grouping and the hypothesis you want to test.
